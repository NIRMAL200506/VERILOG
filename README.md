# VERILOG PROJECTS

Welcome to the **VERILOG Projects Repository**! 
This repository contains a collection of Verilog-based digital design projects, examples, and modules. 
It serves as a resource for learning, practicing, and implementing Verilog designs.

This repository is dedicated to exploring digital logic design using Verilog. 
From basic concepts like gates and flip-flops to advanced modules like ALUs and controllers, you'll find practical examples and reusable code here.

Projects

1. **Basic Logic Gates**
   - Implementation of AND, OR, NOT, XOR gates.
2. **Flip-Flops**
   - D, JK, and T flip-flop designs.
3. **Counters**
   - Synchronous and asynchronous counters.
4. **ALU (Arithmetic Logic Unit)**
   - A simple 4-bit ALU.
5. **Memory Modules**
   - RAM and ROM design.
6. **IoT Applications**
   - Verilog designs integrated with IoT systems.

To get started with this repository:
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/NIRMAL200506/VERILOG.git
   
**Prerequisites**
Before using the projects in this repository, ensure you have the following installed:

A Verilog simulator (e.g., ModelSim, Xilinx Vivado, or Icarus Verilog)
Basic understanding of digital logic design and Verilog HDL.
